                                    Mumbai based Kerul Patel is a Leukemia survivor since 2003. He was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia , 
                                    a rare and potentially deadly form of blood cancer when he was in his early thirties and his little son barely 
                                    a year old. He was put on a revolutionary treatment which does not cure but till keeps his Leukemic cells under 
                                    control; which never lets him forget that he is still living with cancer . His whole life changed of course . 
                                    Goals had to changed and goal posts relocated ; family and work priorities re worked out and thus began his search 
                                    for a new normal . Throughout this period of reconciliation and readjustments he felt the need to find something 
                                    to occupy him and fill those empty spaces within him and give him the strength to cope with the new turn his life 
                                    had taken . This was when he resumed his childhood passion - Karate."
